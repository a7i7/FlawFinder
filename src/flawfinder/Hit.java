              "tmpfile" (temporary file creation), "format" (format string).
              Use "" if you don't have a better category.
    url: URL fragment reference.
    other:  A dictionary with other settings.

  Other settings usually set:

    name: function name
    parameter: the function parameters (0th parameter null)
